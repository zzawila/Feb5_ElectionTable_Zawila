# Election Table
- You’re in a newsroom working on the Republican Iowa Caucus
- You’re tasked with building a results table
- You have access to dummy data
- Your editor wants the table to:
    - To easily ID the winner and top candidates
    - Works on mobile, tablets/small desktops, and desktop
    - Be condensed in size

## Things to keep in mind

- Think about what data needs to be used, and what needs to be prioritized
- Break down the steps to build it out 
- Prioritize a mobile version, then go up
- Talk to me, your editor, to consult on editorial decision
- Hardcode the numbers – do not try to pull in the data from the spreadsheet
- Call me over for any bugs or if you want a review
    - Please try to problem-solve yourself before asking
